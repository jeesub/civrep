Roleplay A City Council Member In CivRep!

CivRep is a graduate student project held at Carnegie Mellon University’s Entertainment Technology Center during the spring semester in 2021.

The team is prototyping a single player civic learning roleplaying game as part of a larger project called CivWiz.

CivRep’s goal is to empower players to understand and believe that they can indeed make an impact on their communities through civic engagement. We will create a playable prototype of the roleplaying module on AirConsole that can then be passed on to the CivWiz team to help guide the development of the roleplaying game application.

The game made using Unity Engine and AirConsole.
